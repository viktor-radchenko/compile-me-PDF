# CompileMe PDF
-------------

We are using PDF files every day. Reports, articles, theses and even plane tickets... And nearly every day we
need to merge PDFs. Sure, Adobe Acrobat can do it all for you but what if you are a student or your credit card is not accepted? 

Keep calm and use CompileMe PDF! Not only you can merge PDFs but also apply watermarks or change page directions. Not impressed? Well, this is all for free, no credit card required! Enjoy!
